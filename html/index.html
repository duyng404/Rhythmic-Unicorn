<div class="h2">What is this about?</div>
<div id="info">
	<p><span class='highlight'>Rhythmic Unicorn</span> is a crowdsourcing project that looks to build a music suggestion database through gamification. We, the team (Duy Nguyen &amp; David Schabelski) wanted to experiment with an idea: an application that is built like a game, has the elements of a game and can used to create valuable output. When people play the game, they help building a database of related songs. This database can then be used by online music services like Google Play Music, Youtube Music or Spotify to help make better suggestions.</p>
	<p>In the game, you will be given a random song, and then challenged to list out other songs that is related to it, as many as possible. The songs can be similar in genre, musical style, or simply the feelings, or &quot;vibe&quot;, you have listening to it.</p>
	<p>The more you answer, the more <span class='highlight'>Contribution Tokens</span> you gain. You can then spend these Tokens to request contribution for a specific song or to browse through the database itself.</p>
	<p>The project is still a WIP, with a lot more stuff is coming in the future. Including a <span class='highlight'>research paper</span>, <span class='highlight'>database statistics</span>, and tons of <span class='highlight'>updates</span> and <span class='highlight'>features!</span></p>
	<p><span class='highlight'>Rhythmic Unicorn</span> is built on Node.js, Expressjs and MongoDB. We also made use of Spotify API and Youtube API for its music database and for previewing songs.</p>
